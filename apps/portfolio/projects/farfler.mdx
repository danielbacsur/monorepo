According to WHO data, more than 1 billion people worldwide have mobility-related issues. Of these, over 130 million people require some form of wheelchair. Since Stephan Farfler invented the wheelchair in the 17th century, the technology saw its first major advancement in the 1960s with the introduction of electric wheelchairs. Our goal is to transform this technology to meet the expectations of the 21st century.

With our project, we aim to assist people with mobility impairments in leading more independent and active lives. The self-driving capabilities provided by our technology enable users to navigate seamlessly, not only on open streets but also in tight office environments, including maneuvering around desks and other furniture. This not only makes their lives easier but also reduces their dependence on daily assistance, significantly alleviating the burden on their personal caregivers.

While our first prototype was designed for indoor use, our goal is to ensure perfect functionality in outdoor environments as well. To achieve this, we have developed a realistic simulation environment that models not only urban conditions but also the wheelchair and its sensor systems. This allows us to predict and test real-life changes, ensuring the reliability of our system against even the toughest challenges before deploying it in actual urban settings.
