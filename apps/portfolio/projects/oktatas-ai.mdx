  Oktatas AI is an educational platform where virtual teachers can deliver 20-minute lessons tailored to students' performance.
  Thanks to numerous media appearances, I have already helped over 5k students and caught the interest of the Hungarian government.

When the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, education faced unprecedented challenges in Hungary and worldwide. Many countries switched to remote learning for varying lengths of time, putting both students and teachers in entirely new situations. A study conducted by researchers at the Budapest Corvinus University and the University of Szeged revealed that students were significantly disadvantaged during this period.

A paper published in the scientific journal Learning and Instruction in February 2023 reported that primary school students experienced learning losses equivalent to 15-16 weeks in reading, 10-11 weeks in science, and 9 weeks in math. Beyond measurable losses, online education led to less tangible but equally impactful consequences: students missed out on communal experiences, and lessons became impersonal due to remote teaching methods.

I belong to the generation whose high school years were disrupted by the pandemic. Reflecting on that time, I realized the most significant issue wasn't just the academic losses but the impersonal nature of education during the lockdown. In many online classes, students didn't even see each other; only initials appeared on screens. This insight motivated me to create a solution to address these challenges. That solution is Oktatás AI, a project aimed at transforming education through artificial intelligence.

Imagine a teacher who is never tired, always accessible, and ready to answer any question about literature, biology, or even technical subjects. Now imagine this teacher being available 24/7. This isn't just a dream—it's the essence of Oktatás AI.

I developed a virtual teacher powered by artificial intelligence. It's a platform where students can ask questions aloud about various subjects, and the teacher—powered by AI—answers them promptly and accurately. The knowledge base is built on Hungary's National Core Curriculum, ensuring the AI draws from reliable, curriculum-based information without fabricating or sharing incorrect data. This makes the system a trustworthy and consistent resource for students.
